# port-based [![arXiv](https://img.shields.io/badge/arXiv-1809.10751-blue.svg?style=flat)(https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.10751)

Jupyter notebooks to calculate the entanglement fidelity and success probability of certain port-based teleportation protocols.

For details and explanations of the terminology used below and in the notebooks, please see [our paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.10751).

## Files

* `det_PBT_std.ipynb`

Notebook to compute the entanglement fidelity for the determinstic standard protocol in dimension `d`.

* `prob_PBT_epr.ipynb`

Notebook to compute the success probability for the probabilistic EPR protocol in dimension `d`.

## Usage

To run the notebooks, you need a working Jupyter installation with the SageMath system enabled. To install these, we highly recommend using the [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) or [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) environments. Once you have a working conda environment installed on your system, follow [these directions](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/installation/conda.html) to install SageMath.
